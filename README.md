# sc-archive

Tool I use to archive and keep track of songs from people I follow on SoundCloud. Requires a cookie relay server which I haven't made public yet, so not usable for the general public.

## Setup

1. Create file `.secret/config.ini` (see `sc_archive/example.ini` for an example)
2. Create file `.env` with line `ARCHIVE_PATH=<path where you want to download tracks to>`
